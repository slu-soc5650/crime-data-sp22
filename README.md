# crime-data-sp22

This is the repository containing the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department's (SLMPD) crime data for the Spring 2022 final projects. All raw data and code is included here for *reference only*. The only file you should have to use is `data/crime.csv`, which contains *n* = 241,748 crimes that were reported by SLMPD between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2019. These years have been selected to correspond to the 2015-2019 5-year American Community Survey estimates.
